# CAPTCHA-Generator

#### _This repository contains the code for generating dataset of different variations of text based CATPCHAs which can further be used to train on Pix2Pix for performance evaluation._ ####

- **Download and unzip the project.**
- **Download the [datasets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1apPR2mOzGvuu0u8mxooBY0LkCTaLdFFX) and extract them in the "Images" folder.**
- **In order to run the code file, open MATLAB and then open the "generateAlphabetDataset.m" located in "code" directory.**
- **The generated CATPCHA images will be saved in "pix2pix" directory. "Day" folder will contain the text CAPTCHA images and "Night" folder will contain the simplified version of those text images.**
